## What this is

ChurchOS is a modular, open-source church CMS built for Libby Church of the Nazarene
and designed for multi-church deployment. It replaces the active church website.

**Version:** 0.1.0 pre-release — Release 1.0.0 is named "Kootenai"

## Monorepo structure

```
apps/
  web/      — Public-facing Nuxt 4 site (homepage, sermons, events, contact)
  admin/    — Admin dashboard Nuxt 4 app (CRUD, content management)
  api/      — FastAPI backend
packages/
  ui/       — Shared component library (design tokens, reusable Vue components)
  config/   — Shared TypeScript/ESLint/Tailwind configs
```

---

## Non-negotiable rules

- **TDD always.** Write a failing test before any implementation. No exceptions.
- **Explain every file.** What it does, why it exists, how it connects.
- **Incremental and verified.** One piece at a time, confirm it works, then move on.
- **Commit often.** git add → commit → push after each meaningful working unit.

---

## Git workflow

- `feature/*` branches cut from `dev`
- Merge path: `feature/*` → `dev` → `staging` → `main`
- `main`, `staging`, `dev` are protected — PRs only, CI must pass
- Never commit directly to `staging` or `main`
- Branch naming: `feature/phase-N-description` or `fix/short-description`

---

## RBAC roles

`superadmin → admin → staff → member → guest`

Enforced in `apps/api/app/dependencies/rbac.py` via `require_role()`.

---

## Security requirements (always enforce)

- Access tokens in memory only — never localStorage
- Refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies only
- JWT verified server-side on every protected endpoint
- RLS active on all sensitive Supabase tables
- PII encrypted at rest (AES-256, column-level)
- Rate limiting via Redis on all write endpoints
- Prayer submissions AI-moderated before going public
- Directory requires member role minimum — never public
- No bulk export endpoint for directory or giving records
- Stripe.js handles all card input — card data never touches our API

---

## Deployed infrastructure

| Service         | URL / Location                                           |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| API (prod)      | https://churchos-production-c6ae.up.railway.app          |
| Public site     | Cloudflare Pages — `churchos` project                    |
| Admin           | Cloudflare Pages — `churchos` project                    |
| Supabase        | churchos-libbynaz project                                |

### Railway environment variables (all required)

| Variable              | Value / Source                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `CHURCH_ID`           | `default` (id of Libby Naz in public.churches) |
| `SUPABASE_URL`        | Supabase project URL                          |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`| Supabase **secret key** (formerly service role) |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | Supabase Settings → API → JWT Settings        |

> **Note:** Supabase renamed keys in 2025: "publishable" = anon key, "secret" = service role key.

---

## Deployment architecture (important)

ChurchOS is a **single-tenant, portable CMS**. Each church gets its own isolated
deployment — their own Supabase project, Railway service, and Cloudflare account.
There is no shared database and no cross-church data isolation needed in code.

Phase 9 ("Multi-church support") means **portability and easy self-hosting**, not
multi-tenancy. A church downloads the repo, sets up their own accounts, and deploys.

Consequence: `church_id` on every table is a per-deployment constant (always
`"default"`), not a tenant discriminator. It stays for self-documentation and
sanity-checking configuration, but queries are never filtering across church IDs.

---

## Supabase schema notes

### Primary key conventions
- `churches.id` — VARCHAR, value `"default"` — intentional singleton config row
- `sermons.id` — VARCHAR(36) — Logos-sync assigned; do not change PK type
- `church_events.id` — being migrated to UUID (table is empty, no external IDs)
- `prayer_requests.id` and all future tables — UUID with `DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`

### Per-table notes
- `public.churches` — singleton row; `id = "default"` for Libby Naz
- `public.sermons` — Logos-synced; `church_id` FK; use PATCH not PUT
- `public.church_events` — manually managed; migrating PK to UUID
- `public.prayer_requests` — Phase 5; UUID PK; RLS enabled; full schema in migration d4e5f6a7b8c9
- `public.profiles` — RBAC roles stored here; linked to `auth.users` (UUID)
- **RLS gaps:** `announcements`, `pages`, `sermon_sync_logs`, `site_config`,
  `alembic_version` are UNRESTRICTED — add RLS policies in Phase 10

## Admin test suite (apps/admin)

52 tests across 8 files — run with `cd apps/admin && pnpm test`

| File                          | Tests | What it covers                  |
|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| tests/placeholder.test.ts     | 1     | Vitest smoke test               |
| tests/stores/auth.test.ts     | 8     | Pinia auth store                |
| tests/layouts/AdminLayout.test.ts | 8 | Sidebar, topbar, slot, sign-out |
| tests/pages/DashboardPage.test.ts | 3 | Welcome page, quick-nav cards   |
| tests/pages/SermonsIndexPage.test.ts | 7 | Sermon list, badges, edit links |
| tests/pages/SermonEditPage.test.ts  | 10 | Edit form, PATCH, feedback      |
| tests/pages/EventsIndexPage.test.ts | 7 | Event list, badges, edit links  |
| tests/pages/EventEditPage.test.ts   | 8 | Edit form, PATCH, feedback      |

**Important vitest gotcha:** `useRoute` is stubbed as a global in `tests/setup.ts`.
Components must NOT import from `#app` — use Nuxt auto-imports (no import statement).
Test files override with `vi.stubGlobal('useRoute', () => ({ params: { id: '...' } }))`.

---

## API test suite (apps/api)

Run with `cd apps/api && python -m pytest --tb=short`

- `tests/test_auth.py` — JWT verification, RBAC, profile lookup
- `tests/test_sermons.py` — Sermon CRUD endpoints (37 tests)
- `tests/test_events.py` — Event CRUD endpoints

**Important:** Uses `PyJWT` (not `python-jose`). Import as `import jwt` and
catch `jwt.exceptions.InvalidTokenError` (not `JWTError`).

---

## Known issues / tech debt

- Public website (Phase 2) still uses mock sermon/event data — wire to API in Phase 10
- Alembic migrations not yet stamped against existing Supabase tables (need `alembic stamp b2c3d4e5f6a7`)
- Several Supabase tables have no RLS policies (see schema notes above)
- Logos sync not yet active (sermons exist in DB from prior manual work)
