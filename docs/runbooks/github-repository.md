# Runbook — GitHub repository settings

> **Maintainer runbook** for `pj1227/churchos`. It is not part of the ChurchOS product docs.
> **Owner:** Joel Cossins · **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-09 (Claude Code audit)
> **Review:** at every release PR (`staging` → `main`), and in full once a quarter.
> Update "Current state" and tick items as you go, and note the date of each review in
> the log at the bottom.

What this covers: branch rules, required checks, merge settings, security features,
Actions permissions, environments and secrets, and anything connected to the repo
from outside (Railway, Cloudflare).

## 1. Current state (audit 2026-10-09)

| Area | Setting today | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Visibility | **Public** | Free security features are available but switched off (see §2) |
| Rulesets | `protect-main`, `protect-staging`, `protect-dev`: no deletion, no force-push, PR required, 0 approvals, all merge methods allowed | **No required status checks**, so a PR with failing CI can be merged |
| Classic branch protection | On `main` and `staging`, duplicating the rulesets, also with no required checks | Two systems doing one job |
| Auto-delete merged branches | Off | ~35 stale branches have built up |
| Secret scanning / push protection | Off | A pasted key could be committed without warning |
| Dependabot alerts / security updates | Off | No notice of vulnerable dependencies |
| Workflows | `ci.yml` (PRs + pushes to `dev`); `deploy-staging.yml` (push to `staging` → Cloudflare Pages `churchos-staging`; Railway step is a no-op); `deploy-production.yml` (push to `main` → Cloudflare Pages `churchos` + `railway up`) | Old stack; replaced in Phase 1 |
| Outside integrations | **Cloudflare Workers and Pages GitHub app** builds `churchos` and `churchos-staging` on its own (N0b). **Railway GitHub app** auto-deployed `main` to Railway project "responsible-spontaneity" (28 deployments, last 2026-07-20), *in addition to* the workflow's `railway up` | ~~Every production merge deploys the API twice~~ Fixed 2026-10-09 (N0). The workflow's `railway up` remains until Phase 1 (P3) |
| Secrets | `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_TOKEN`. Workflows also reference `STAGING_/PROD_SUPABASE_*`, which don't exist and resolve to empty values | Old stack |
| Environments | `churchos-staging (Production)` (Cloudflare), `responsible-spontaneity / production` (Railway) | Leftovers |
| Hosting (for reference) | `libbynaz.org` and `test.libbynaz.org` → Namecheap server `162.0.215.160` (LiteSpeed web server, Namecheap DNS). `api.libbynaz.org` not created yet | — |

## 2. Do now (before Phase 1)

Each item says what to change, what it does, and where to find it.

### ☑ N0 — Disconnect Railway's auto-deploy (owner, before any Phase 1 code) — done 2026-10-09
- **What it does:** stops Railway deploying this repo on its own whenever `main` changes.
- **Why now:** Phase 1 removes `apps/api`. Without this, the first merge to `main`
  makes Railway try to deploy a repo with no API.
- **How to check which project it is:** in Railway, open project
  **"responsible-spontaneity"** → its service → **Settings → Source**. If it shows
  `pj1227/churchos`, that's this one. The production URL
  `churchos-production-c6ae.up.railway.app` should belong to it. A devfolio project
  would show a devfolio repo instead.
- **Where:** Railway → the project → service → Settings → Source → **Disconnect**.
  Keep the service running or delete it as you prefer: libbynaz.org doesn't use it.
- **GitHub side:** profile → Settings → Applications → Installed GitHub Apps → Railway →
  Configure → Repository access. Keep `pj1227/devfolio` (it uses Railway); remove
  `pj1227/churchos`. Railway then receives no events from this repo.

### ☐ N0b — Remove this repo from the Cloudflare GitHub App
- **What it does:** stops Cloudflare Pages building this repo on its own. The
  "Cloudflare Pages: churchos" and "Cloudflare Pages: churchos-staging" checks on
  commits come from the **Cloudflare Workers and Pages** GitHub App, separately from
  the workflows' `wrangler pages deploy`, so Cloudflare was also deploying twice.
- **Why now:** once Phase 1 removes the old apps, those automatic builds would fail
  on every push. Nothing on libbynaz.org uses the Cloudflare sites.
- **Where:** profile → Settings → Applications → Installed GitHub Apps → **Cloudflare
  Workers and Pages** → Configure → Repository access → remove `pj1227/churchos`, keeping
  any other repo that still uses it → **Save**.

### ☑ N1 — Require CI to pass before merging — done 2026-10-09
- **What it does:** the Merge button stays disabled until the listed checks are green.
  This enforces the CLAUDE.md rule "all CI jobs required".
- **Where:** Settings → Rules → Rulesets → open **protect-dev** → tick **Require status
  checks to pass** → **Add checks**, and add both:
  - `Lint · Type-check · Build · Test (JS/TS)`
  - `Test (pytest)`

  Leave "Require branches to be up to date before merging" **off** for now. Save, then
  repeat for **protect-staging** and **protect-main**.
- **Note:** a check only appears in the search after it has run in the last 7 days.
  Both ran on PR #80. These names change in Phase 1 (see P2).

### ☑ N2 — Set merge methods per branch — done 2026-10-09
- **What it does:** keeps the long-lived branches in sync.
  - **protect-dev:** allow **Squash** only. One tidy commit per feature.
  - **protect-staging** and **protect-main:** allow **Merge commit** only. Release
    merges keep their shared history, so later releases merge cleanly. Squashing
    between long-lived branches makes them drift apart and conflict.
- **Where:** each ruleset → **Require a pull request before merging** → **Allowed
  merge methods**.

### ☐ N3 — Remove the duplicate classic branch protection
- **What it does:** leaves the rulesets as the single source of branch rules.
- **When:** after N1 and N2, so there's never a gap.
- **Where:** Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → delete the rules for
  `main` and `staging`.

### ☐ N4 — Automatically delete merged branches
- **What it does:** deletes a feature branch once its PR merges, so nothing is left behind.
  `dev` and `staging` are safe because their rulesets block deletion. Confirm on the
  first `dev` → `staging` release PR that `dev` survives.
- **Where:** Settings → General → Pull Requests → tick **Automatically delete head branches**.

### ☐ N5 — Turn on the free security features
- **What they do:**
  - **Secret scanning + push protection:** refuses a push that contains a recognisable
    key or token, before it becomes public.
  - **Dependabot alerts:** warns when a dependency has a known vulnerability.
  - **Dependabot security updates:** opens PRs that fix those vulnerabilities. They
    still go through CI and your review.
- **Where:** Settings → Advanced Security (called "Code security" on some accounts).

### ☑ N6 — Read-only default token for workflows — already set (verified 2026-10-09)
- **What it does:** workflows get read-only access unless a workflow asks for more.
  The current workflows already declare what they need.
- **Where:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Read repository
  contents and packages permissions**. Leave "Allow GitHub Actions to create and
  approve pull requests" **unticked**.

## 3. Phase 1 (planned with the Phase 1 plan; listed here so nothing is forgotten)

### ☐ P1 — Deployment environments
- Create environments **`test`** and **`production`** (Settings → Environments).
- Each one holds its own deploy secrets (SSH host, port, user, private key, known
  hosts) for the Namecheap account, so a test workflow can never use production
  credentials.
- **Deployment branches:** `test` ← `staging` only; `production` ← `main` only.
- **`production` → Required reviewers: `pj1227`.** Each production deploy waits for
  you to click **Approve**. That's your release button after signing off on test.

### ☐ P2 — Update the required checks
- Replace the N1 check names with the new CI jobs (lint, static analysis, unit,
  contract, e2e, contrast) in all three rulesets.

### ☐ P3 — Retire the old stack
- Delete the secrets `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_TOKEN`.
- Delete the environments `churchos-staging (Production)` and
  `responsible-spontaneity / production`.
- Delete the Cloudflare Pages projects `churchos` and `churchos-staging`, and the
  Railway project if nothing else uses it.

### ☐ P4 — Dependabot version updates
- Add `.github/dependabot.yml` for npm, Composer and GitHub Actions: weekly, grouped
  into one PR per ecosystem. Goes through the normal workflow (shown before writing).

### ☐ P5 — Which Actions may run
- Settings → Actions → General → **Allow pj1227, and select non-pj1227, actions** →
  GitHub-created actions plus an explicit list. This matches the dependency-approval
  rule: a new action gets added to the list only after approval.

### ☐ P6 — Branch cleanup
- Delete stale branches. Keep `fix/rls-recursion-and-site-config`,
  `chore/supabase-keepalive` and `feature/phase-8a-site-content-cms` until the
  archive notes no longer need them (they're also preserved by the archive tag's history).

## 4. Review checklist (every release PR)

- [ ] Required checks in all three rulesets match the CI job names
- [ ] No new secrets or environments you don't recognise
- [ ] No new outside integrations (Settings → GitHub Apps / Integrations)
- [ ] Dependabot and secret-scanning alerts are empty or handled
- [ ] No stale branches left from merged work

## 5. Review log

| Date | By | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-09 | Claude Code | Initial audit (§1); recommendations N0–N6, P1–P6 |
| 2026-10-09 | Claude Code | Found the Cloudflare GitHub App also building this repo (N0b). The red ✕ on `main` (d20348d) is Railway's own deploy cancelled by the simultaneous workflow deploy |
| 2026-10-09 | Owner + Claude Code | N1 + N2 done: rulesets re-imported (new ids `protect-dev` 24813168, `protect-staging` 24813175, `protect-main` 24813187); both CI checks required from GitHub Actions (app 15368), merge methods squash → `dev`, merge commit → `staging`/`main`. Verified via API; PR #80 mergeable and clean. N6 was already read-only. Ruleset JSON exports kept in the owner's `Documents/GitHub/churchos` folder (`*.original.json` = before) |
| 2026-10-09 | Owner | N0 done: Railway source disconnected (project `f4a80fcb-…`); `churchos` removed from the Railway GitHub App's repository access, `devfolio` kept. The old Railway API service is still running (unused) |
